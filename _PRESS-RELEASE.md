There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  California Water Use Visualization Through the Drought

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Californian residents who want to help conserve water by doing more than taking shorter showers but lack information. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Our product provides a simple, intuitive way to interact with our water use dataset and learn how their daily decisions and political decisions impact the drought.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  There is a lack of information about water use in California. Most people only know that agriculture is responsible for the bulk of the usage.
  Likewise the only advice usually given is to take shorter showers and stop watering lawns.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Our product provides a suite of simple data visualization tools to inform users about the compelex reality of water use. 
  This allows users to be more informed politically and in their daily lives.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  We provide easy to use visualization tools to make Californian citizens informed and empowered when it comes to our drought.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Simply visit our website and explore by water use category, or time or county.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  I never realized how much more water my county was using over the past five years. I've now become much more involved politically
  as a result.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  After using our water use visualization tools you will be informed about where the water goes.
  The next step for you is to make changes in your daily life and become politically involved in the issue
